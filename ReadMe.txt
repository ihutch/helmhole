This code helmhole constructs synthetic electron hole axisymmetric equilibria

Provided it has link access to libX11, it can be made on linux by typing "make"
at the command line.

Then ./helmhole -h will give some help. Without switches it will
calculate and display the figures of the paper: "Synthetic
Multidimensional Plasma Electron Hole Equilibria", by I H Hutchinson
(2021).
